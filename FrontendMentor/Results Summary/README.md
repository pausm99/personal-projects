## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I've learned to combine containers using both Flexbox and CSS Grid. I also practiced with HSL colors as I had only worked with RGB so far. 

### Continued development

I want to get deeper into CSS Flexbox and in the future, learn preprocessed CSS such as Sass or LESS to implement new projects.
